# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
This is the final project of the Getting and Cleaning Data Course.

The script, `run_analysis.R`, would function in the following ways:

  1.Download the material and unzip the file.
  
  2.Load the information of subjects and activities
  
  3.Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set
  
  4.Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
  
  5.Convert the `subject`and `activity` columns into factors.
  
  6.Create a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
